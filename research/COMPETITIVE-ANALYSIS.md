## Conclusion

EMPM Dumpsters has a solid foundation with 20+ years of experience and differentiated services (same-day, clean-outs, personal attention). However, the digital presence significantly underrepresents the business compared to competitors.

**The opportunity:** Most local competitors have weak websites and no online booking. Trash Daddy has proven the model works — their Inc. 5000 recognition and 700+ reviews show that investing in digital experience drives growth.

**The risk:** Doing nothing means continuing to lose customers who expect online research and booking capabilities. Trash Daddy and other regional players will continue capturing market share.

**The path forward:** Rebuild the website with modern capabilities (online booking, size guides, reviews), while emphasizing EMPM's authentic local advantages (20+ years, personal service, clean-out expertise).
